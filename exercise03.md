## 题目：It is often the case that the frictional force on an object will increase as the object moves faster. A fortunate example of this is a parachutist; the role of the parachute is to produce a frictional force due to air drag, which is larger than would normally be the case without the parachute. The physics of air drag will be discuss in more detail in the next chapter. Here we consider a very simple example in which the frictional force depends on the velocity. Assume that the velocity of an object obeys an equation of the form where _a_ and _b_ are constants. You could think of _a_ as coming  from an applied force, such as gravity, while _b_ arises from friction. Note that the frictional force is negative(we assume that _b>0_), so that it opposes the motion, and that it increases in magnitude as the  velocity increases. Use the Euler mothod to solve(1.10) for _v_ as a function of time. A convenient choice of parameters is _a=10_ and _b=1_. You should find that _v_ approaches a constant value at long times; this is called the terminal velocity.
