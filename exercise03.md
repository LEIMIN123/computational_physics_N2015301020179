# 摘要
## 题目：It is often the case that the frictional force on an object will increase as the object moves faster. A fortunate example of this is a parachutist; the role of the parachute is to produce a frictional force due to air drag, which is larger than would normally be the case without the parachute. The physics of air drag will be discuss in more detail in the next chapter. Here we consider a very simple example in which the frictional force depends on the velocity. Assume that the velocity of an object obeys an equation of the form
